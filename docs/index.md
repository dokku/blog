## [Release 1.3.0]

__The 1.3.0 release introduces user and team management in the UI while revamping
the internal design of the product.__

---

Dokku has traditionally been a single-tenant PaaS solution, where all users
had access to all functionality on the server. While there were community
plugins that tackled authentication, each implementation had it's rough edges due
to interfaces in Dokku itself. Dokku Pro 1.2.0 polishes those edges while
introducing a flexible permission system for organizations that need it.

## [Release 1.1.0]

__The 1.1.0 release is the first substantive update to Dokku Pro, and it brings
with it great changes around usability and functionality.__

---

Dokku Pro was released in late 2021 to early bird users willing to deal with a
bit of pain in exchange for supporting the project and vision. While it
technically worked, there were quite a few places for easy improvement, as well
as obvious holes in the existing functionality. Dokku Pro 1.1.0 aims to fill
some of those needs, laying the groundwork for future enhancements

## [Comparing Cloud Native Buildpacks to Herokuish]

An upcoming piece of technology in the container space is Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNB). This is an initiative led by Pivotal and Heroku and contributed to by a wide range of community members, and one that the Dokku project has been following fairly closely. CNB builds upon the buildpack "standard" initially developed at Heroku, modified at Pivotal for Cloud Foundry, and used/abused by the `gliderlabs/herokuish` project. This post goes over a small amount of history, compares buildpack implementations across vendors, and talks about the future of buildpacks as they relate to Dokku.

## [The Dokku Experience]

Dokku has historically had no way to introspect on the state of an installation. At one point in its history, we included a "backup" feature, which allowed users to export - and _maybe_ import - configuration and data. The challenge is in exposing this information in an easily parseable manner.

## [Resource Management in Dokku]

Every so often, user's ask if it's possible to use Dokku as the basis of a system where each user in Dokku would have access to _only_ their applications. Because of various reasons, this isn't possible out of the box, though it's certainly within the realm of possibility.

There are two requirements for such a system, one of which we'll cover here.
